## Project: BIM Shamans

> The term **_shamanism_** comes from the Manchu-Tungus word **_šaman_**. The noun is formed from the verb **_ša-_**, which means **_to&nbsp;know_**. **_A shaman_** is literally **_'one who knows'_**.

Throughout our lives, we have had the opportunity to witness the development of BIM and its accompanying technologies firsthand. We saw how the studios and companies we worked for purchased their first licenses for "BIM software," appointed their first BIM manager, and undertook the challenge of initial standardizations. We observed this closely, being active participants in design, coordination, standardization, and modeling processes. We created the first automations, Dynamo scripts, work principles, and invented tricks to overcome the limitations imposed by software developers.

Over time, we became "those who know" – the go-to people for answers.

We were united by an approach that prioritizes results, bypassing marketing fluff, and focusing on engineering solutions. While the proponents of various software, data exchange formats, CDEs, or standards preached their superiority and infallibility, we, with shamanic tenacity, focused on completing the next project.

We were always on the front line – where BIM was being implemented, often skipping places where BIM was only talked about.

As part of our "shamanic" project, we will share our thoughts, curiosities, and our own solutions and automations. It won't be about what BIM should be, but what it is and what we can do with it.

We have often seen how "only correct" plans failed when faced with real projects. For this reason, we do not intend to convince anyone that our approach is the right, revolutionary, or best in the world. However, we can guarantee that it has worked somewhere!
