## Project: BIM Shamans

> The term **_shamanism_** comes from the Manchu-Tungus word **_≈°aman_**. The noun is formed from the verb **_≈°a-_**, which means **_to&nbsp;know_**. **_A shaman_** is literally **_'one who knows'_**.
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/shamanism">~ Britannica.com</a></p>

#### TL;DR
We solve problems which satellitees civil enginneering, BIM technology, automation and data analysis. What unites us is a results-first approach - cutting through the marketing fluff and taking a straight engineering path to the goal, in the spirit of **make engineering approach great again**.

## About the project

For years, **we have been closely following the evolution of BIM and the technological solutions** that come with it. We witnessed how the studios and companies we worked for purchased their first licenses for ‚ÄúBIM software,‚Äù appointed their first BIM managers, and took on the challenge of their first standardization efforts. We observed it all up close - actively participating in design, coordination, standardization, modeling, and data management processes ourselves. We created the first automations, Dynamo scripts, workflows, and even devised tricks to bypass the limitations imposed by software developers. Over time, **we became 'those who know'** - the ones people turn to for answers.

**We've always been on the front line, where BIM HAPPENS** ‚Äî not just in theories and discussions but in the daily grind of project challenges. In our ‚Äúshamanic‚Äù project, we share insights, tricks, and automations. We won‚Äôt be preaching what BIM should be - we‚Äôll show you what it is and how much you can squeeze out of it, right here and now.

Time and again, **we‚Äôve seen how the so-called ‚Äúonly right‚Äù solutions collapse when faced with real-world challenges‚Äîthe daily struggles of designers, engineers, and clients**. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not here to convince anyone that our approach is the ultimate, the most revolutionary, or the best in the world. But we do know that it works - we‚Äôve tested it on the front lines, where ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù plans often lose to reality. Experimentation is a daily practice in BIM, and we‚Äôre not afraid to try new things. We‚Äôll also allow ourselves a bit of complaining and a few jokes, because we want to show that we enjoy what we do - solving the challenges that cross our path.

**What brought us together was a results-driven mindset‚Äîone that skips the marketing fluff and takes a straight engineering route to the goal.** While the high priests of this or that tool, data exchange format, or standard preached their superiority, we - like stubborn shaman, were busy finishing yet another project.

            <h3>Julian Wandzilak</h3>
            <p>I am an independent architect, designer, C# developer, and a BIM coordinator.</p>

            <p>I've gained my professional experience working in the UK (Manchester, London), USA (Chicago) and Poland (Krak√≥w). I was also involved in architectural projects in Australia and Norway.</p>

            <p>During my professional life I've been involved in preparing masterplans, factories, healthcare projects, education, high-end residential projects, high-rise buildings (residential & student), interiors for a museum, extensions and refurbishment of heritage-listed projects and small houses. I also took part in some competitions. Lately I did some concepts for playgrounds and historic gardens‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>All of it showed me that everywhere in the world we have a similar problem - "WE NEED MORE AUTOMATIONS". Sadly no one is interested in doing it for us!</p>

            <p>Because of that I decided to do it myself. I learnt programming and so far published two plugins for Autodesk Revit ‚Äì Drafter and Leveler. They automate the work of architects and engineers, allowing them to do their tasks faster. Drafter is one of the largest plugins for Revit out there containing around 180 automations helping you to work faster!</p>

            <p>You can get them from Autodesk App Store, and both were featured as the most popular paid plugins there at some point during last 6 months! And more apps are under construction!</p>

            <p>Also, I am a UAV pilot (VLOS and BVLOS, up to 25kg) and photographer (You can find me in some books). And I do 3d models, 2d & 3d graphic design, brand identities and laser scanning for construction (point clouds are so cool) üòâ And I am probably interested in too many things but "specialisation is for insects‚Ä¶".</p>

            <h3>Natalia Gawlik</h3>
            <p>I'm a BIM Coordinator who is working on large-scale infrastructure projects, especially railways. With nine years of experience, I've worked on diverse projects, from photogrammetry, 3D laser scanning, drone and land surveying, 3D modelling to BIM.</p>

            <p>At work, my focus is on the 'I' in BIM ‚Äì the information. After all, BIM without information is just a fancy 3D model.</p>

            <p>I'm always on the lookout for automation opportunities because, let's face it, no one wants to spend their day manually entering data into a model.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I'm pretty lazy and can't stand doing boring tasks over and over‚Ä¶ That's why I try to find the fastest, most efficient ways to automate my work.</p>

            <p>Automation isn't just a passion; it's a necessity ‚Äî so I can spend more time hiking, training or chilling on the terrace with my adorable cat üêæ</p>

            <p>If there's a shortcut, I've probably already coded it üòä</p>

            <p>I'm the kind of person who sees a repetitive task and thinks: "I won't waste my colleagues' or my own potential on endless clicking‚Ä¶" ü§î You are here, so we've got that in common ü´°</p>

            <p>I believe automation is the key to minimizing human errors, cutting out tedious, time-consuming work, and ensuring thorough checks before delivery.</p>

            <p>BIM Coordinator, BIM Manager, and Civil Engineer with structural design expertise, on-site experience, and an unlimited building license for managing and design. I'm currently working as a BIM Coordinator in the Advanced Technology and Life Science industry and as a BIM Manager in Real Estate.</p>

            <p>Throughout my professional journey, I've spent hours creating and controlling models for material take-offs, managing clashes, looking for potential technical issues (spinning a model from left to right üòé), and verifying input and output data.</p>

            <p>I'm a huge fan of the BIM concept as a significant advancement and transparency improvement for the civil engineering industry. Professionally, I focus on eliminating inefficiencies and overproduction, developing useful data flows, and creating effective checklists to control them. In my free time, I enjoy both indoor and outdoor climbing and long hiking trips.</p>
