  - title: "Observation"
    content: "For years, **we have been closely following the evolution of Digital Delivery and the technological solutions** that come with it. We witnessed how the studios and companies we worked for purchased their first licenses for \"BIM software,\" appointed their first BIM managers, and took on the challenge of their first standardization efforts. \n\n  We observed it all up close - actively participating in design, coordination, standardization, modeling, and data management processes ourselves. We created the first automations, Dynamo scripts, workflows, and even devised tricks to bypass the limitations imposed by software developers. Over time, **we became 'those who know'** - the ones people turn to for answers."

    content: "**We’ve always been on the front line, where BIM HAPPENS** - not just in theories and discussions but in the daily grind of project challenges. \n\n In our “shamanic” project, we share insights, tricks, and automations. We won’t be preaching what BIM should be - we’ll show you what it is and how much you can squeeze out of it, right here and now."

  - title: "Tryouts"
    content: "Time and again, **we've seen how the so-called \"only right\" solutions collapse when faced with real-world challenges - the daily struggles of designers, engineers, and clients.** That's why we're not here to convince anyone that our approach is the ultimate, the most revolutionary, or the best in the world. But we do know that it works - we've tested it on the front lines, where \"correct\" plans often lose to reality. \n\n  Experimentation is a daily practice in BIM, and we're not afraid to try new things. We'll also allow ourselves a bit of complaining and a few jokes, because we want to show that we enjoy what we do - solving the challenges that cross our path."

      - title: "Independent Architect & Programmer"
        content: "I've gained my professional experience working in the UK (Manchester, London), USA (Chicago) and Poland (Kraków). I was also involved in architectural projects in Australia and Norway. **During my professional life I've participated in preparing masterplans, factories, healthcare projects, education, high-end residential projects, high-rise buildings, interiors for a museum, extensions and refurbishment of heritage-listed projects and small houses.** \n\n All of it showed me that everywhere in the world we have a similar problem - 'WE NEED MORE AUTOMATIONS'. Sadly no one is interested in doing it for us! So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I learned to program and started publishing. You can find my plugins for Revit on the Autodesk App Store – Drafter and Leveler. They automate the work of architects and engineers, allowing them to complete tasks faster and with predictable repeatability."
      - title: "Expertise & Tools"
        content: "**Dynamo scripts** | **Revit automation** | **C# development** | **Plugin creation** | **Workflow optimization** | **Data management**\n\n- Published **Drafter** and **Leveler** plugins on Autodesk App Store\n- Drafter contains ~180 automations for streamlined daily work\n- **UAV pilot** (VLOS and BVLOS, up to 25kg)\n- **3D modeling**, 2D & 3D graphic design, brand identities\n- Laser scanning for construction (point cloud processing)"
      - title: "Specialization Philosophy"
        content: "I believe that **\"specialisation is for insects\"** — the best solutions come from interdisciplinary thinking. I am a UAV pilot and photographer (You can find me in some books). And I do 3d models, 2d & 3d graphic design, brand identities and laser scanning for construction (point clouds are so cool) And I am probably interested in too many things but as I said, 'specialisation is for insects…'."

      - title: "Infrastructure BIM Coordinator & Workflow Specialist"
        content: "I'm a BIM Coordinator with a strong background in large-scale infrastructure projects. My background is in land surveying, but over time, my focus shifted toward BIM and it became the field where I could focus on everything I enjoy — technology, programming and problem-solving. Over the past decade, my career has taken me from photogrammetry and laser scanning, through drone mapping and 3D modeling (Scan to BIM), all the way to BIM coordination, automation and project management using VDC methodology on public projects in Norway."
      - title: "Expertise & Tools"
        content: "**Focus on the 'I' in BIM** — Information is what gives models meaning. I automate the process of creating and managing property sets in models.\n\n**Tools & Skills:**\n- **Dynamo** | **Grasshopper** | **Quadri Automation Tool**\n- **Python** (IfcOpenShell) for IFC processing\n- **Property set management** & data consistency\n- **Scan to BIM** workflows\n- **VDC methodology** implementation\n- **3D model optimization** & standardization"
      - title: "Specialization Philosophy"
        content: "To be honest, I'm **too lazy for boring tasks**. I can't stand doing the same thing many times if I can automate it. Yes, I may have spent hours coding just to skip a 10-minute task. No regrets 😄\n\nFor me, automation isn't just a technical solution — it's what gives me the freedom to do more of what I love: **hiking**, **training**, and **relaxing on the terrace with my charming cat** 🐾"

        content: "I'm Civil Engineer with structural design expertise, on-site experience & unlimited building license. **I work as BIM Coordinator and BIM Manager with industrial projects across Advanced Technology and Life Science area and also in Real Estate market**. This wide experience allows me to think about BIM as a standarized way of enhancing digital design and delivery, construction process support and awarenes of data use. My responsibility is to assure both, a final product and the way to achieve it, as reliable as possible, filling the needs of all participant. \n\n I'm the kind of person who sees a repetitive task and thinks: 'I won't waste my colleagues' or my own potential on endless clicking...' **I believe automation is the key to minimizing human errors, cutting out tedious, time-consuming work, and ensuring thorough checks before delivery**. Standardization, on the other hand, is the foundation of successful automation."

      - title: "Specialization Philosophy"
        content: "I'm a **fan of the BIM concept itself** as a major leap forward in transparency, standardization, process organization, and reducing wasted effort in the construction industry.\n\nI focus on **eliminating inefficiencies and overproduction, developing data workflows and maximizing data reuse across the widest possible range of use cases**. I support teams with following the rules and reasons of 'BIM' on the project, proceed QA checks and (what I really like to be honest) participate in a design process as clash verifier and data analyst. As automation specialist, I'm looking for potential to significantly improve daily work with technology support.\n\nIn my free time: **Indoor and outdoor climbing, long hiking trips and discovering new things.**"
